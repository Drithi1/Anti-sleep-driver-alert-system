# Anti-sleep-driver-alert-system
A microcontroller-based safety system designed to detect driver drowsiness and prevent accidents. The project uses an eye-blink/IR sensor to monitor eyelid movement in real time. When the driver’s eyes remain closed beyond a safe limit, the system triggers a loud buzzer alert to wake them up.
